# 🎓 Student Course Management System Using Python Sets

This is a beginner-friendly Python project demonstrating the power of **sets** to manage student enrollments, compare students between courses, and perform real-world set operations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Manage students in **Course A** and **Course B**
- Find students in **both** courses (intersection)
- Find **all** students (union)
- Find students **unique** to one course (difference)
- Find students **not common** to both (symmetric difference)
- Add new students to either course
- Auto-remove duplicates (set property)

---

## 🧠 Why Sets?

Sets are perfect for:
- Removing duplicates automatically  
- Fast membership checking  
- Finding common or unique items  
- Mathematical operations  

Used commonly in:
- Data engineering  
- Machine learning preprocessing  
- Database deduplication  
- User management systems
